This page is providing Analysis on Hospital Associated Infection in which we are visualizing the mortility rate among 41 countries. We are comparing Hospital 
Associated Infection mortality</br> rate with 3 other causes which are Breast cancer, HIV and Road Accident. We are doing this anlysis on 17 years of data that is
from year 2000 to 2016.
In this Analysis we are trying to show</br> that the mortality rate of hospital infection is more than the other 3 causes and we should be considerent towards
Hospital Associated Infection and should not take it lightly. We should take </br>steps to reduce the risk of loosing the lives due to Hospital Associated Infection.

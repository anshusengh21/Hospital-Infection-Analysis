<h2><strong> Recommendations</strong></h2>

The responsibility of HAI prevention is with the healthcare facility. Hospitals and healthcare staff should follow the recommended guidelines 
for sterilization and disinfection. Taking steps to</br> prevent HAIs can decrease your risk of contracting them by 70 percentTrusted Source or more. 
However, due to the nature of healthcare facilities, itâ€™s impossible to eliminate 100</br> percent of nosocomial infections.</br>

Some general measures for infection control include:
<ul>
<br>
<li>Screening the ICU to see if people with HIAs need to be isolated.</br></li>
<br>
<li>Identifying the type of isolation needed, which can help to protect others or reduce chances of further infection.</br></li>
<br>
<li>Observing hand hygiene, which involves washing hands before and after touching people in the hospital.</br></li>
<br>
<li>Wearing appropriate gear, including gloves, gowns, and face protection.</br></li>
</br>
<li>Cleaning surfaces properly, with recommended frequency.</br></li>
<br>
<li>Making sure rooms are well ventilated.</br></li>

<ul>
<br>
<li>Follow the aseptic insertion technique to minimize infection.</br></li>

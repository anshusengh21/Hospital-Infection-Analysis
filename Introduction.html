<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
Health care facilities range from well equipe clinic and technologically advance super speciality hospitals to primary health care centre with only 
basic facility. Despite all the progress made in public </br>
health, hospital and health care the rate of infections amongst in-patients continues to increase, which also affects members of the hospital staff. 
Decrease immunity increase in the number and</br> 
variety of invasive techniques and medical procedures create potential roots of infection amongst in-patients. In addition poor infection control 
practices in crowded hospitals further facilitate and</br> 
promote transmission of drug resistant bacteria.
<br>Worldwide around 14 lac people suffer from hospital infection association about 30% of patients admitted to hospitals and nursing home.</br>

<h3><strong>Defination</strong></h3>
A Hospital-acquired infection also known as a nosocomial infection, is an infection that is acquired in a hospital or other health care facility To emphasize 
both hospital and nonhospital settings, <br>it is sometimes instead called a healthcare–associated infection).Infections are considered nosocomial if they first 
appear 48hrs or more after hospital admission within 30 days after discharge.</br>
Affecting both developed and developing countries, Nosocomial infections are prevalent everywhere in the world. Hospital associated infections from the 
majority of causes of increased morbidity </br>and death amongst hospitalized patients translating into a significant burden on both, patient and public health. 
The most likely complication of hospital care is hospital associated infection. </br>
The world health organization (WHO) has estimated that these infections 
occur in 7 to 12 % of hospitalized patient world over. Highly frequency of nosocomial infections is indicative of poor</br> 
quality health care and leads to 
escalation in the cost treatment which is largely avoidable.

<br>Following are the most common nosocomial infections:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Urinary tract infection</li>
<li>Catheter associated infection</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
<li>Blood stream infection</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Symptoms</strong></h3>
<p><br>For a HAI, the infection must occur:</br>
<ul>

<li>up to 48 hours after hospital admission</li>
<li>up to 3 days after discharge</li>
<li>up to 30 days after an operation</li>
</ul>
in a healthcare facility when someone was admitted for reasons other than the infection
Symptoms of HAIs will vary by type. </br>The most common types of HAIs are:
<ul>
<li>urinary tract infections (UTIs)</li>
<li>surgical site infections</li>
<li>gastroenteritis</li>
<li>meningitis</li>
<li>pneumonia</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The symptoms for these infections may include:
<ul>
<li>discharge from a wound</li>
<li>fever</li>
<li>cough, shortness of breathing</li>
<li>burning with urination or difficulty urinating</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>nausea, vomiting, diarrhea</li>
</ul>
People who develop new symptoms during their stay may also experience pain and irritation at the infection site. Many will experience visible symptoms.

<h3><strong>Who is at Risk</strong></h3>
Anyone admitted to a healthcare facility is at risk for contracting a HAI. For some bacteria, your risks may also depend on:
<ul>
<li>your hospital roommate</li>
<li>age, especially if you’re more than 70 years old</li>
<li>how long you’ve been using antibiotics</li>
<li>whether or not you have a urinary catheter</li>
<li>prolonged ICU stay</li>
<li>if you’ve been in a coma</li>
<li>if you’ve experienced shock</li>
<li>any trauma you’ve experienced</li>
<li>your compromised immune system</li>
</ul>

Your risk also increases if you’re admitted to the ICU. The chance of contracting a HAI in pediatric ICUs is 6.1 to 29.6 percent.
A studyTrusted Source found that nearly 11 percent of roughly</br> 300 people who underwent operations contracted a HAI. Contaminated areas 
can increase your risk for HAIs by almost 10 percent.

HAIs are also more common in developing countries.</br> Studies show that five to 10 percent of hospitalizations in Europe and North America 
result in HAIs. In areas such as Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, it’s more than 40 percent.
